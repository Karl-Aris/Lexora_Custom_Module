X Return Module
=================
This is an auto-generated Odoo 17 module that:
 - Creates model `x.return`
 - Auto-creates x.return records when stock.move.line entries are created and their reference or picking name contains 'WH/INT/RETURN' (case-insensitive)
 - Provides tree/form views and a menu action filtered to those references

Install:
 1. Unzip the module into your Odoo addons path.
 2. Update the app list and install the 'X Return (Auto-copy from stock.move.line)' module.
